            <p>
                I’m a Software Engineer and Web Developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. 
                My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I’m usually analyzing animated films, modeling 3D prints, collecting plants, or plotting what corner of the world to discover next.
